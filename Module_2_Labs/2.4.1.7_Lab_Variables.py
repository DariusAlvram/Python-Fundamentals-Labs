Objectives
    Become familiar with the concept of storing and working with different types of data in Python.
    Experiment with the code in Python.
Scenario
    Here is a story:

    Once upon a time in the Apple Land, John had three apples, Mary had five apples, and Adam had six apples. They were all very happy and lived for a very long time. End of story.

    Your task is:

    * Create the variables: juan, maria, and adan.
    * Assign values to variables. The value must be equal to the number of apples that each one had.
    * Once the numbers have been stored in the variables, print the variables on one line, and separate each one with a comma.
    * Then you must create a new variable called total_manzanas and must be equal to the sum of the three previous variables.
    * Print the value stored in total_manzanas on the console.
    * Experiment with your code: creates new variables, assigns different values to them, and performs various arithmetic operations with them (for example, +, -, *, /, //, etc.). Try putting a string with an integer together on the same line, for example, "NÃºmero Total de Manzanas:" and total_manzanas.

print(f"Total number of apples: {total_apples}")

#-> Experiment with the code using other math operations
num_persons = 3
print(f"Apples per person from total: {total_apples/num_persons}")
print(f"Apples per person from total (truncated): {total_apples//num_persons}")
print(f"Total of apples: {(total_apples/num_persons)*num_persons}")
print(f"Total of apples (Juan + Adan): {total_apples-maria}")
